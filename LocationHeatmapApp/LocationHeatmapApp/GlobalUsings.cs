// Ensure the namespace 'LocationHeatmapApp.Data' exists and is correctly referenced.  
// If the namespace does not exist, you may need to create it or verify the project structure.  

// Check if the 'Data' namespace is defined in the project. If it is missing, you may need to add the corresponding folder and files.  
// Example: Create a folder named 'Data' under 'LocationHeatmapApp' and add relevant classes or files.  

// If the namespace exists but the error persists, ensure the project containing 'LocationHeatmapApp.Data' is added as a reference to the current project.  
// In Visual Studio, right-click the project, select 'Add Reference', and ensure the correct project or assembly is referenced.  

// If the namespace is defined in another assembly, ensure the assembly is correctly referenced in the project.  
// Example: Add the assembly reference in the .csproj file or through Visual Studio's 'Add Reference' dialog.  

// If none of the above resolves the issue, provide additional context or code to help identify the root cause.
